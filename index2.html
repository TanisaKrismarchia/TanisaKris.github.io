	<h2>This is a bit about myself and what I do...</h2>
	<p>My name is <em><b>Tanisa Krismarchia</b></em>. I was born in Batam on March 17th 2002. <br>I am a 11th Grade student in Bogor Vocational High School of Chemical Analyst. I entered this school because I really want to work in a Laboratory, but now i kinda regret it a lil bit because the material in this school is quite hard to follow. <br>So for anybody who want to enter this school, please think twice and carefully. For the things what I do, you can see on down below!!</p>

	<p><b>My Entertaining Hobby</b></p>
	<p>Below, youâ€™ll find the belated hobby of mine, which is dancing. I wish I could edit more of my photos with my plenty kind of hobbies (I am too lazy and it is quite hard to edit my photos) but looking back at these, I did a very good job. LOL.</p>

	<p><b>What Is Idol For Me?</b></p>
	<p>For me an idol is a person I wish I could meet and I really like. Yeah! I have an idol, his name is Lee Jeno and he is a member from SM Entertainment korean boy group named NCT. It would be a dream come true if I could meet him someday (not only in my dream hehe)</p>
